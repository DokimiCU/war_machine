# War Machine

A game prototype for Minetest.

As the forever war enters its second millennium, a new droid is added to the fight.

(Caution: This game will give you shell shock.)


## Development Status

I made most of this prototype of a game a long time ago.

I'm making it public in case someone else wants to build this into an actual game.

War Machine has some fun stuff in it, but currently doesn't make much sense as a game.

- Gameplay is not balanced, has no real goal or progression
- Code is a mess (a lot is rough copy paste from elsewhere)
- Code is probably out of date
- Missing features
- Features present, but not accessible in gameplay

This is a base to build on for making your own game, but that will take a lot of work. I myself will not be developing this further.


## Some suggestions for how to take this further:

- The core game is super-intense sci-fi combat, plus the building of fortifications to survive that fight (e.g. bunkers that can withstand fullscale bombardment).

- give it a goal (currently it is a pointless forever war)

- might work better with limited size "arenas" rather than an open world?

- might be a good multiplayer game? Like capture the flag

- control pacing (bombardment and combat becomes numbing)

- balance. NPCs have no chance against a human player. Weirdly enough my earlier versions were far more interesting. It was mostly singleplayer vs swarms of NPCs all under hyper-intense bombardment on a regular Minetest map that was getting reduced to ash.

- performance: large numbers of mobs and explosions gets laggy.

- Think deeper about the meaning of war games. Everyone, including the player, is a robot for a reason. It's also why I'm not developing it further. Personally, I'd want to see a game that handles the subject in a mature way.

- Give it some narrative: maybe something along the lines of Forever War, by Joe Haldeman. Possible theme - how vast, incomprehensible, and dehumanizing an actual battlefield is.
